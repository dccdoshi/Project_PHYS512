## Repository Structure
### \src
In the src folder, you will find the lightcurve.py and ttv.py files. This contains the code we have written to calculate the lightcurves and TTV curves based off of the N-body simulations that we run in the jupyter notebooks. 

### \Code_Tests
In this folder, you will find jupyter notebooks for each code test that we have outlined in our report. You will also see the resulting plots and figures. 

### \Results
In this folder, you will find the jupyter notebook where we ran our final results on the TOI-270 system. You will also see the resulting plots and figure.
